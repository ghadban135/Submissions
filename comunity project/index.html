                        An essential problem of the 21st century is environment changing to the worse.
                        Currently the environment is so contaminated that urgent measures need to be taken.
                        There is no part of the earth that does not remain affected by our actions.
                        Our actions are now threatening the health of our planet, the land we live and work on, the water supply,
                        the ozone layer, the animal species as well as the health of our species.
